                <p><span id="welcome">Welcome to Sabibleti!</span><br> This is the platform for those who grew up playing  with Barbie dolls  or  binge-watching  classic Barbie movies over and over. This could be a nostalgic experience and bring back fond childhood memories. <br> These movies were such an integral part of my childhood, and today, I feel like I do not give them enough credit for that. <br> So I created this space to express my love and appreciation for all the characters , that over the course of 19 years, have never failed to brighten my day.</p>
